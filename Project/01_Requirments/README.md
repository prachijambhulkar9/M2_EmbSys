## SWOT ANALYSIS

1.Strength
* It can change the speed of the motor as per the need.
* It can change the direction of rotation of the motor as per the need.

2.weakness
* It is only limited to small ratings dc motor.
* Sudden stoppage of the motor is not possible.

3.Opportunities
* A wide range of speed controllers can be made for high rating of a motor.
* Multiple motors can be controlled.

4.Threats
* A wide range of speed controller for the high rating of a motor is already available in the market.

## 5W's and 1H's
1.Who:
* The person who has basic knowledge of speed controlling.
* The person who wants to change the speed of appliances on which he working.

2.What:
* To get controllable speed.
* To change direction and speed of moving robot.

3.When:
* When there is a need for a change in speed.
* When there is a need to control speed and direction of motor as per requirement.

4.Where:
* For domestic purposes.
* For Industrial purposes.
* For defense purposes.

5.How:
* Using ATmega328 as a controller to control the speed and direction of dc motor.
* Detail requirements
